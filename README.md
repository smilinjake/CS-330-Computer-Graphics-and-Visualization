**How do I approach designing software?**
_I approach software design by defining clear goals, identifying user needs, and looking at the problem from every angle to figure out the most modular way of solving it._

- What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  - I improved my ability to structure interactive 3D environments and organize visual elements.

- What design process did you follow for your project work?
  - I followed an iterative design process: research, prototype, test, and refine based on feedback from personal testing and professor grades on milestones.

- How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
  - I can apply the same iterative and user centered approach to improve efficiency and adaptability in future projects.

**How do I approach developing programs?**
_I focus on planning logic first, then coding in manageable pieces while testing frequently for reliability._

- What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
  - I learned to use texture mapping and helper functions to keep the code dry. 

- How did iteration factor into your development?
  - Iteration enabled me to test the changes that i was making to the code. Since most of OpenGL was new to me, playing around with it to see what happened was a big part of completing this project. 
- How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
  - I became more structured—using version control, modular code, and testing regularly to maintain clean and functional code.

**How can computer science help me in reaching my goals**
_Computer science strengthens my problem-solving skills and opens pathways for innovation in technology-driven careers._

- How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
  -  They show me a glimpse of what it takes to make all of the complex visuals that we see every day everywhere. And all practice experience with C++ doing object oriented programming, is useful for getting that muscle memory for later on. 

- How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
  - They teach me how to represent complex data visually. This is extremely valuable for design, simulation, and software development careers structured around the front-end.
  - It also taught me that I do not want to work on the front end...
